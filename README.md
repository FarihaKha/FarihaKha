**FarihaKha/FarihaKha** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:
-->

- 🔭 I’m currently working on developing machine learning models for neurodegenerative diseases like Parkinson's Disease and Alzheimer's Disease, exploring the fascinating world of computational neuroscience
- 🌱 I’m currently learning advanced neural networks like ResNet, LSTM, and Bi-GRU, traditional models such as SVM and Naive Bayes, and experimenting with ensemble methods like Random Forests and Gradient Boosting
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on open-source projects in biotech or neuroscience and creative tech initiatives that make a difference in people's lives
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with advice on breaking into the biotech + software/machine learning engineering field
- 💬 Ask me about web development, crafting efficient algorithms, and brain research
