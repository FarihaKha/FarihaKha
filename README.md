## Hi there 👋, I'm Fariha!!

<!--
**FarihaKha/FarihaKha** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:
-->

- 🔭 I’m currently working on developing machine learning models for neurodegenerative diseases like Parkinson's Disease and Alzheimer's Disease, exploring the fascinating world of computational neuroscience
- 🌱 I’m currently learning advanced neural networks like ResNet, LSTM, and Bi-GRU, traditional models such as SVM and Naive Bayes, and experimenting with ensemble methods like Random Forests and Gradient Boosting
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on open-source projects in biotech or neuroscience and creative tech initiatives that make a difference in people's lives
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with advice on breaking into the biotech + software/machine learning engineering field
- 💬 Ask me about web development, crafting efficient algorithms, and brain research
- 📫 How to reach me: farihankha@gmail.com

- 😄 Pronouns: she/her
- ⚡ Fun facts:
    - I got into CS while messing with Inspect Element on random websites
    - I believe debugging = detective work 🕵️‍♂️
- 📂 Michael J. Fox Foundation Machine Learning Challenge Project (Break Through Tech AI Program):
Check out my team's project repository for detecting Freezing of Gait (FoG) in Parkinson’s patients using ML that we worked on for the Michael J.Fox Foundation for over 3 months, as part of the Break Through Tech AI Program's Fall 2024 AI Studio!
