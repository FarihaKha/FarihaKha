**FarihaKha/FarihaKha** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:
-->

- 🔭 I’m currently working on developing machine learning models for neurodegenerative diseases like Parkinson's Disease and Alzheimer's Disease, exploring the fascinating world of computational neuroscience.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning 
    - Deepening my understanding of neural networks like RNN, LSTM, and Bi-GRU, as well as traditional models like SVM and Naive Bayes
    - Experimenting with ensemble methods like Random Forests and Gradient Boosting
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on open-source projects in biotech or neuroscience and creative tech initiatives that make a difference in people's lives
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with advice on breaking into the biotech + software/machine learning engineering field
- 💬 Ask me about machine learning and brain research
- 📫 How to reach me: farihankha@gmail.com
- 😄 Pronouns: she/her
- ⚡ Fun fact: ...
    - I got hooked on tech while messing with Inspect Element on random websites
    - I believe debugging = detective work 🕵️‍♂️
